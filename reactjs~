Hooks - 
new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions.
Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.
Hooks work side-by-side with existing code.
React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState, useEffect

A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later. If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
